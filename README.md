# Personalized Characters App - @2020 - Made by Stefan Tutuianu

## About

```
You can create your own virtual characters. It has 2 characters (child + parent) but can be added more if needed.

App built with Vue CLI -  Vue version 2.6

For animation of checkboxes I have used pretty-checkbox-vue version 1.1 .

The app has Snipcart integrated which will pass the final selections as product description.

The characters can be fully customized (the functionality exists). I have reused some ilustrations.

The app is fully responsive.
